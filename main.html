    <p>This collection of unusual specimen preparations, including freeze-dried displays of muscles, feet, tongues, and
        other anatomical parts, was created by Milton Hildebrand, Professor Emeritus, University of California at Davis,
        and a former MVZ graduate student. Hildebrand developed and perfected most of the anatomical techniques used in
        his specimen preparations, and many items in the collection are cross-referenced to laboratory exercises in
        vertebrate functional morphology courses that he designed. These unique and often delicate anatomical
        preparations makes them especially valuable for teaching, but also prohibits their availability for loans.</p>
