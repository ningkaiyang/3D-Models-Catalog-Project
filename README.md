# 3D-Models-Catalog-Project
Aim is to build a site that can easily be fit into https://mvz.berkeley.edu/ through their Other Collections link
that can host the Hildebrand Anatomical Collection's 3D models in an organized and styled manner
with templates that can be used to quickly add new pages for new models as we scan and insert each of them.

Learning a lot of CSS and design mostly :p
